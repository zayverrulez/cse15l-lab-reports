# Week 8 Lab Report 4

* A link to your markdown-parse repository and a link to the one you reviewed in week 7
* For each test above:
    * Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site
    * Showing the code in MarkdownParseTest.java for how you turned it into a test
    * For your implementation, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
    * For the implementation you reviewed in Week 7, the corresponding output when running the tests; if it passed, say so. If it didn’t pass, show the specific part of the JUnit output that shows the test failure.
* Answer the following questions with 2-3 sentences each:
    * Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 1 and all related cases that use inline code with backticks? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
    * Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 2 and all related cases that nest parentheses, brackets, and escaped brackets? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
    * Do you think there is a small (<10 lines) code change that will make your program work for snippet 3 and all related cases that have newlines in brackets and parentheses? If yes, describe the code change. If not, describe why it would be a more involved change.
* If your code already works on some/all test cases, include an explanation of what were the code changes that allowed the tests to pass.
