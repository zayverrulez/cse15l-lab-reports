To start, we downloaded Visual Studio Code at the following website URL: 
https://code.visualstudio.com/

Then we followed the instructions to install it on our computers.

## Remotely Connecting

Firstly, OpenSSH has to be installed on my computer:
https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php

Following this guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh#_connect-to-a-remote-host

I opened up the terminal, typed in:

`ssh `

then I added my specific account username.

`cs15lsp22auw@ieng6.ucsd.edu`

Finally, once prompted, I typed in my password. Once connected the computer listed the System stats.

System Stats:

    * Last Login
    * Quota
    * 0% of CPU
    * Cluster Status
    * Prepping
