# Week 10 Lab Report 5


Explain:
* How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the
results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you
use some other programmatic idea?)
* Provide a link to the test-file with different-results (in the provided repository or
your repository , either is fine)
* For each test:
    * Describe which implementation is correct, or neither if both give the
wrong output
    * Indicate both actual outputs (provide screenshots) and also what the
expected output is (list the links that are expected in the output).

Decide on what it should produce (i.e., expected output) by using either
VScode preview or the CommonMark demo site.

Note : Following shows a screenshot of a markdown file and its preview.
Even though “some-url.com” and “google.com” are shown as links
(highlighted in blue) that is not what we are looking for in MarkdownParse
and the correct expected output would simply be [ucsd.edu].

* For the implementation that’s not correct (or choose one if both are
incorrect), describe the bug (the problem in the code) in about 2-3
sentences. You don’t have to provide a fix, but you should be specific
about what is wrong with the program, and show the code that should
be fixed (Provide a screenshot of code and highlight where the change
needs to be made).
